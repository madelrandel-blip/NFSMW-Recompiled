# NFSMW Recompiled

A static native recompilation of **Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005)**, Xbox 360,
built on the [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk).

> Reference title ID: `454107D9`

This is **not an emulator**. The PowerPC code inside the game's `default.xex` is
translated ahead of time into C++, then compiled into a native x86-64 binary. There
is no JIT and no instruction interpreter at runtime — the game's own logic runs as
native code. What the SDK provides is everything *around* that: the Xbox 360 kernel
calls, the filesystem, audio, input, and a translation of the Xenos GPU to Direct3D 12.

**You need your own copy of the game.** This repository contains no game data, no
`default.xex`, no generated C++, and no compiled binary — and it never will. See
[Legal](#legal).

**Launcher download:** the standalone launcher (choose your own ISO, configure and
play) is on the [Releases](https://github.com/Sampreeth004/NFSMW-Recompiled/releases)
page. You still need to build the game from your own disc dump; the launcher only
picks the ISO and configures the run.

## Status

Playable, with rough edges. Known to run start to finish through the prologue and
into free roam on an Intel Iris 540 (a weak integrated GPU) at roughly 18–38 FPS
at 854×480.

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Boot, menus, free roam | Working |
| Audio | Working. A decoder deadlock that killed sound and froze the game on returning to the menu is fixed — see [docs/diario/audio-cuelgue.md](docs/diario/audio-cuelgue.md) |
| Graphics (D3D12) | Working. Both EDRAM emulation paths are selectable; the fast one roughly doubles the frame rate on integrated GPUs |
| Graphics (Vulkan) | Compiles and loads, renders black on Intel. Untested elsewhere |
| Controller and keyboard | Working |
| V-sync and frame limiting | Working, via a local patch — neither exists in the stock SDK |
| Internal resolution scaling | Working, up to 4× |
| Save games | Working |
| Multiplayer | **Not working.** The privilege gate is solved; the network layer underneath is not. See [docs/diario/red-y-privilegios.md](docs/diario/red-y-privilegios.md) |

## What you need

- Windows 10 or 11, x64
- Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools (MSVC + Windows SDK)
- CMake 3.28+, Ninja, Clang 20+
- Python 3.10+
- A copy of the ReXGlue SDK checked out next to this repository
- Your own ISO or GOD dump of Need for Speed: Most Wanted for Xbox 360

Full setup instructions: [docs/00-entorno.md](docs/00-entorno.md) (Spanish).

## Build

```bat
tools\bootstrap.ps1          :: clones and builds the ReXGlue SDK into ..\rexglue-sdk
EXTRAER_XEX.bat              :: pulls default.xex out of your ISO into assets\
CONSTRUIR.bat                :: patches the SDK, recompiles it, builds the game, packages build\
```

`CONSTRUIR.bat` is the whole pipeline. It applies every patch this project carries,
rebuilds the SDK (that is where the fixes live), runs the code generator, compiles the
game, assembles a portable `build\` folder, verifies that folder is self-contained, and
finally writes two ready-to-send folders into `..\build release\`:

- `NFSMW Windows x64\` — playable, with the game executable inside. Zip it and send it
  to someone who owns the game; **never** publish it (see [Legal](#legal)).
- `NFSMW Windows x64 - Portable\` — everything except the game executable. This one is
  safe to publish.

The ISO is left out of both. The script refuses to finish if anything that looks like
game data ends up in the publishable folder.

## Documentation

The README and the technical documentation are in English.

| Document | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [docs/arquitectura.md](docs/arquitectura.md) | How the pieces fit: SDK, app, patches, launcher |
| [docs/compilar.md](docs/compilar.md) | Building from a clean checkout |
| [docs/parches.md](docs/parches.md) | Every patch: what it changes, why, and how it was verified |
| [docs/04-usa.md](docs/04-usa.md) | USA (NTSC) support: region deltas, overrides, the FP fix |
| [docs/lanzador.md](docs/lanzador.md) | The launcher, its settings and how it is built |
| [docs/rendimiento.md](docs/rendimiento.md) | Measured findings: EDRAM paths, resolution scaling, frame pacing |
| [docs/problemas-conocidos.md](docs/problemas-conocidos.md) | What is broken and how far each one was traced |
| [docs/diario/](docs/diario/) | Long-form write-ups of the harder diagnoses |

The diary is worth reading before touching the audio or graphics code. Each entry
records what the evidence actually said, including the times a plausible theory turned
out to be wrong.

### Why the fixes are patches against the SDK

Almost nothing this project fixes lives in the game application. The audio deadlock,
the missing v-sync, the graphics API selector, the Xbox Live privilege gate — all of
them are in ReXGlue, and they end up compiled into `rexruntime.dll`, not into the game
executable. So the build patches the SDK source, rebuilds it, and only then builds the
game.

Every patch is a Python script that applies and reverts by exact text replacement,
block by block. They refuse to touch anything if an anchor does not match exactly once,
they are idempotent, and `--revertir` restores the original. Run any of them with
`--estado` to see what is applied. The reasoning behind that design, and the bugs that
forced it, are in [docs/parches.md](docs/parches.md).

## Android launcher (APK)

The `android/` directory contains a standalone Android port: a launcher APK where
you pick your own game ISO, configure the engine and play, with an on-screen
Xbox 360 gamepad overlay. It targets arm64-v8a (Android 8.0+), renders through
Vulkan (Plume or Xenos plugin) and outputs audio through AAudio.

The port is based on the Android build by
[WINDROID-EMU](https://github.com/WINDROID-EMU/NFSMW-RECOMP) (itself forked from
[madelrandel-blip](https://github.com/madelrandel-blip/NFSMW-Recompiled)); this
fork carries it with an English launcher UI and builds against this fork's own
USA codegen output.

Build it on Windows with `CONSTRUIR_APK.bat` (requires the Android SDK, NDK
27.2.12479018 and CMake 3.22.1; paths are in the script header). The same legal
rules apply: the APK contains the game's own translated code, so it is for your
own use and must never be distributed.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first — the
short version is that patches carry their reasoning in the code, and a change that
fixes something should say what evidence says it is fixed.

## Legal

Static recompilation of a game you own, for your own use, sits on the same ground as
emulation: the translated code derives from a binary you bought.

What must **never** be distributed:

- `default.xex` or any other game file
- the C++ the code generator produces from it
- **the compiled game executable** — it contains the game's own code, translated

What is shared here is the *patch*: configuration, hooks, stubs, scripts and
documentation. Never the game.

The launcher's cover art and icon are Electronic Arts' artwork and are **not** in this
repository. The launcher builds and runs without them; see
[docs/lanzador.md](docs/lanzador.md) if you want to supply your own.

⚠️ IMPORTANT ROM REQUIREMENT: this fork supports the Need for Speed: Most Wanted (2005) [Xbox 360] ROM in two versions: **PAL Spain** (the original target of the Spanish project) and **NTSC/USA** (English, added by this fork). PAL UK is not supported. See [docs/04-usa.md](docs/04-usa.md) for the USA build notes.
